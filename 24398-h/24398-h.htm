 <h1>Punch, or the London Charivari</h1>

  <h2>Volume 104, April 22nd 1893</h2>

  <h3>edited by Sir Francis Burnand</h3>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>[pg 181]</span>



<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<div class="figright" style="width: 410px;"><a href="images/181-1500.png"><img src="images/181-400.png" width="400" height="331" alt="'The strange sea-creatures which made their appearance.'" /></a>
<h4>"The strange sea-creatures which made their appearance."</h4></div>

<p>Two gentlemen of artistic and literary attainments, having studied
the romances of <span class="sc">Victor Hugo</span> for the sake of being inspired by that
Grand Old Master's style, determined to essay a "thriller" of most
tragic type. These two single authors, Messrs. <span class="sc">Wyatt</span> and <span class="sc">Ross</span>,
being
rolled into one, wanted, like the Pickwickian Fat Boy, "to make our
flesh creep." In their one-volume Hugoesque romance, <i>The Earth
Girl</i>, bound in pale grass-green, with blood-red title, they
have most unequivocally succeeded. The heroine, The Earth Girl, who, at
the last, is sent back whence she came, and so ends by being the
"Earth-to-Earth"
Girl, is named <i>Terra</i>; she commences by being <i>Terra Incognita</i>, she
is never <i>Terra Firma</i>, but her existence, in its consequences to all who
come within her influence, is quite a reign of <i>Terra</i>. The authors are to
be
congratulated on not having yielded to a great temptation by styling their story
<i>The Earth Girl; or, Terra-ra-ra-Boom!</i> The scene is laid chiefly in the
Island of Breke&mdash;but to give too many details would spoil the intending-reader's
pleasure. So, as <i>Hamlet</i> observes, "Breke, Breke my heart, for
I must hold my tongue!" The Earth Girl first sees the light, such as it is, in a
cavern, and is brought up on raw eggs fresh from the sea-bird's nest,
uncooked herbs, and raw fish. No tea, coffee, milk, or liquors of any
description, were within reach of this unhappy family of three,
consisting of Pa, Ma, and the Infant Phenomenon. How they slaked
their thirst is not clearly stated, unless a sort of aquarium, in which
some amiable sharks reposed, was a fresh-water tank. This wild
girl was elegantly brought up, as far as their somewhat straitened
circumstances would permit, for she learned songs and ballads,
French, English, and the Norman <i>patois</i> of the Channel Islands. In
these peculiar troglodytian surroundings she had never learned the
use of parasol or umbrella, and was entirely ignorant of harp, piano,
and the "use of the globes." Coming up out of the caves and
breathing once more the upper air, we naturally find ourselves in
higher society, and are introduced to a handsome old Peer, <i>Lord
Netherdale</i>, who has two sons, the half-brothers <i>Royallet</i>, one of
whom gaily addresses his respected parent as "The Paladin of
Paters," and is not at once locked up in Colney Hatch. The old Peer is as
eccentric
as he is handsome, and he takes up his residence on the Island of Breke, where
"the fruit,
the vegetables, the strange sea-creatures" (odd fish?), "which made their
appearance on his
table," (this sounds as if the strange sea-creatures walked in unasked. Queer
place this Breke for a Breke-fast party!) "pleased him." He was easily pleased.
Then "he began to think the island cider preferable to Pommery. In short, the
eccentric Peer
fell in love with Breke." Well! he must have been an eccentric Peer to prefer
Channel Island
cider, even from the best orchards, to the '84, '80, and '74&mdash;the last still
existing
in some exceptionally favoured spots&mdash;from the vinevards of Pommery.
This eccentric nobleman on seeing the Island of Breke, observed the
absence of a landing-stage, and jocosely remarked to himself,
"They're in want of a <i>pier; I</i> will fix myself there." And so he
did. But of all that happened to him there and elsewhere, and to the
Earth-to-Earth Girl, and to the two sons, is it not to be read by the
purchaser in the book itself, which, the Baron is pleased to add, will
well repay perusal, and will hold the reader's attention to the very
last line. At least, this was its effect on the not always easily
pleased.</p>

<h3>A NEW "ARNOLD'S EXERCISE."</h3>

<p><span class="sc">My Dear Mr. Dacre,</span></p>

<p>I have seen your Play, and, since then,
I have not seen any other like it. "When
will I come again?" To see it twice within
a week would be too ecstatic a joy for a dweller&mdash;may
I say a Liver&mdash;in London, who is more
at home as one of the Lights of Asia. So, for
the present&mdash;to paraphrase what I believe
were the words of a popular poet whose name
has passed from my memory&mdash;such, alas! is
popularity&mdash;I will say to you, "Not to-day.
<span class="sc">Dacre</span>"&mdash;(I fancy the last word was "Baker"
in the original Syriac)&mdash;but, some other day,
when, as one of the Lights aforementioned, I
shall, at a <i>Matin&eacute;e</i> be day-lighted to re-witness
your admirable performance.</p>

<p>Yours ever most sincerely sincere,</p>

<p class="author"><span class="sc">Edwin Tails-lose,</span> C.B.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;"C.B." is not "Commander of the
Bath," but stands for "<i>Cox and Box</i>," in
which piece (have you ever played it? I
forget&mdash;but how perfect you would be as
<i>Sergeant</i> or <i>Corporal Bouncer!</i>) you will find
the immortal quotation which precedes these
descriptive initial letters.</p>

<p><span class="sc">A Button-hole for Mr. Chamberlain.</span>&mdash;At
the sale of the Quorn House Orchids,
Mr. G. <span class="sc">Hardy</span> purchased a <i>Cattleyn Mendelli</i>
for 220 <i>guas</i>. Perhaps Mr. <span class="sc">Chamberlain</span>
wouldn't bid, having mistaken "Mendelli"
for "Mundella." But to have
entered the house in a careless fashion, with
a "glass (with care)" in his eye, and a
two-hundred-and-twenty-guinea Orchid in
his button-hole, would have been a great
sight for "<span class="sc">Joey B"-irmingham</span>.</p>

Yokohama, March 30 (<i>vi&acirc;</i> Victoria, B.C.,

friend, Mrs. R., who forthwith exclaimed,
"'April 11, B.C.!' and only arrived here now&mdash;April
12, A.D.!"</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="sc">Change of Name.</span>&mdash;All congratulations
to the Duke and Duchess of Fife. Great
alterations and improvements are, it is said,
being made at Mar Lodge. The name also is
to be altered, and henceforth it is to be known

<h2>CHEAP AT ANY PRICE.</h2>

<p><i>Mrs. Britannia</i> (<i>effusively</i>). And now, my
dear children, do you know the meaning of
Imperial Federation?</p>

<p><i>Australia</i> (<i>promptly</i>). Yes, dear Mamma.
We are all to live as a happy family.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Brit.</i> (<i>fondly</i>). Quite right, sweetest.
And can you tell me how this is to be
managed?</p>

<p><i>Canada</i> (<i>with decision</i>). By mutual defence,
dear Mamma.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Brit.</i> (<i>smilingly</i>). My love, your answer
is quite correct. And how shall we manage
this mutual defence?</p>

<p><i>Cape Colony</i> (<i>in a business-like manner</i>). By
providing all sorts of things, dear Mamma.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Brit.</i> (<i>proudly</i>). Very good, little
<span class="sc">Hope</span>; you are always ready with an answer.
And now, can any of you tell me what those
things will be?</p>

<p><i>India</i> (<i>without hesitation</i>). Money, and coal

<p><i>Mrs. Brit.</i> (<i>affectionately</i>). Certainly,
darling; you have given exactly the proper
reply. And now, will not all this cost a
large sum of money?</p>

<p><i>Tasmania</i> (<i>with much decision</i>). A very
large sum of money, dear Mamma&mdash;an
immense sum, dear Mamma.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Brit.</i> (<i>kindly</i>). Yes, my child, you
are perfectly right. And now, my cherished
daughters, one more question. Who will

Who will have to find the money to secure

<h2>ELEVATING THE MASSES.</h2>

<h4>(<i>A Purely Imaginary Sketch</i>.)</h4>

<p><span class="sc">Argument</span>&mdash;Mrs. <span class="sc">Flittermouse</span>, <i>having got up a party to
assist her
in giving an Entertainment at the East End, has called a meeting
for the purpose of settling the items in the programme.</i></p>

<p><span class="sc">Scene</span>&mdash;Mrs. <span class="sc">Flittermouse's</span> <i>Drawing-room in Park Lane.
Everybody
discovered drinking tea, and chatting on matters totally
unconnected with Philanthropy.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Flittermouse</i> (<i>imploringly</i>). Now, <i>please</i>, everybody,
<i>do</i> attend!
It's quite impossible to settle anything while you're all talking
about something else. (<i>Apologies, protests, constrained silence.</i>)
<span class="sc">Selina</span>, dear, what do you think it would be best to begin with?</p>

<p><i>The Dowager Lady Dampier.</i> My dear <span class="sc">Fritilla</span>, I have no
suggestion to offer. You know
my opinion about the whole
thing. The people don't want
to be elevated, and&mdash;if they did&mdash;entertaining
them is not the
proper means to set about it.
But I don't wish to discourage
you.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Flitt.</i> Oh, but I think
we could do so <i>much</i> to give
them a taste for more rational
and refined amusements, poor
things, to wean them from the
coarse pleasures which are all
they have at present. Only we
must really decide what each of
us is going to do.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Perse-Weaver.</i> A violin
solo is always popular. And
my daughter <span class="sc">Cecilia</span> will be
delighted to play for you. She
has been taught by the best&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Cecilia.</i> Oh, Mother, I couldn't,
really! I've never played in
public. I <i>know</i> I should break
down!</p>

<p><i>Lady Damp.</i> In that case,
my dear, it would be certainly
unwise on your part to attempt
it.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.-W.</i> Nonsense, <span class="sc">Cecilia</span>,
nonsense. You <i>won't</i>
break down, and it wouldn't
matter in the least if you did.
<i>They</i> wouldn't notice anything.
And it will be such excellent
practice for you to get accustomed
to a platform, too. Of
<i>course</i> she will play for you,
dear Mrs. <span class="sc">Flittermouse</span>!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Flitt.</i> It will be <i>so</i> good
of you, Miss <span class="sc">Weaver</span>. And it
won't be like playing to a <i>real</i>
audience, you know&mdash;poor
people are so easily pleased,
poor dears. Then I will put
that down to begin with. (<i>She
makes a note.</i>) Now we must
have something quite different
for the next&mdash;a reading or
something.</p>

<p><i>Lady Honor Hyndleggs.</i> A&mdash;nothin' <i>humorous</i>, I hope. I do think
we ought to avoid anythin' like descendin' to their level, don't you
know.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Lovegroove.</i> Might try something out of <i>Pickwick</i>. "<i>Bob
Sawyer's Party</i>," you know. Can't go far wrong with anything out
of <span class="sc">Dickens</span>.</p>

<p><i>Miss Diova Rose.</i> Can't endure him myself. All his characters
are so fearfully common; still&mdash;(<i>tolerantly</i>) I daresay it might
amuse&mdash;a&mdash;that class of persons.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Flitt.</i> I must say I agree with Lady <span class="sc">Honor</span>. We should try
and aim as high as possible&mdash;and well, I think <i>not</i> <span class="sc">Dickens</span>, dear
Mr. <span class="sc">Lovegroove. <i>Tennyson</i></span> might do perhaps; he's written some
charmin' pieces.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Lovegr.</i> Well, fact is, I don't go in for poetry much myself.
But I'll read anythin' of his you think I'm equal to.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Flitt.</i> Why&mdash;a&mdash;really, it's so long since I&mdash;and I'm afraid
I haven't one of his poems in the house. I suppose they are down at
Barn-end. But I could send to <span class="sc">Cutt And Hawthorn's</span>. I daresay
<i>they</i> would have a copy somewhere.</p>

<p><i>Miss Sibson-Gabler.</i> Surely <span class="sc">Tennyson</span> is rather&mdash;a&mdash;retrograde?
Why not read them something to set them <i>thinking</i>? It would be
an interesting experiment to try the effect of that marvellous Last
Scene in the <i>Doll's House</i>. I'd love to read it. It would be like a
breath of fresh air to them!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.-W.</i> Oh! I've seen that at the Langham Hall. You remember,
<span class="sc">Cecilia</span>, my taking you there? And <span class="sc">Corney Grain</span>
played <i>Noah</i>. To be sure&mdash;we were <i>quite</i> amused by it all.</p>

<p><i>Miss S.-G.</i> (<i>coldly</i>). This is <i>not</i> amusing&mdash;it's a play of
<span class="sc">Ibsen's</span>.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Flitt.</i> Is that the man who wrote the piece at the Criterion&mdash;what
is it, <i>The Toy Shop</i>? <span class="sc">Wyndham</span> acted in it.</p>

<p><i>Lady Damp.</i> No, no; <span class="sc">Ibsen</span> is the person there's been all this
fuss about in the papers&mdash;he goes in for unconventionality and all
that. I may be wrong, but I think it is <i>such</i> a mistake to have anything
unconventional in an Entertainment for the People.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Flitt.</i> But if he's being <i>talked</i> about,dear Lady
<span class="sc">Dampier</span>,
people might like to know something
about him. But perhaps
we'd better leave <span class="sc">Ibsen</span> open,
then. Now, what shall we have
next?</p>

<p><i>Miss Skipworth.</i> I tell you
what would fetch them&mdash;a skirt-dance.
I'll dance for you&mdash;like
a shot. It would be no end
of fun doin' it on a regular platform,
and I've been studyin'
<span class="sc">Flossie Frillington</span>, at the
Inanity, till I've caught her
style exactly.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Kempton.</i> Oh, I say, you
can give her a stone and a
beatin' any day, give you my
word you can. She doesn't
put anythin' like the go into it
you do.</p>

<p>[<i>Miss S. accepts this tribute
with complacency.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Flitt.</i> A skirt-dance
will be the very thing. It's
sure to please the people we
shall bring over for it&mdash;and of
course they'll be in the front
rows. Yes, I must put <i>that</i>
down. We ought to have a
song next. Mrs. <span class="sc">Tuberose</span>, you
promised to come and sing for
us&mdash;you will, won't you?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Tuberose.</i> Delighted! I
rather thought of doing a dear
little song <span class="sc">Stephan Otis</span> has
just brought out. It's called
"<i>Forbidden Fruit</i>," and he
wrote it expressly for me. It
goes like this.</p>

<p>[<i>She sits down at the piano,
and sings, with infinite expression
and tenderness.</i></p>

<p><i>Several Voices.</i> Charmin'.... <span class="sc">Otis</span> puts so much real feeling into

<p><i>Lady Damp.</i> I should have thought myself that it was rather
advanced&mdash;for an East-End audience&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Tuberose</i> (<i>nettled</i>). Really, dear Lady <span class="sc">Dampier</span>, if
people
see nothing to object in it <i>here</i>, I don't see why they should be more
particular at the East-End!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Flitt.</i> Oh no,&mdash;and as if it matters what the <i>words</i> are in a
song. I daresay if one heard <i>their</i> songs&mdash;&mdash;Now we want another
song&mdash;something as different as possible.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Gardinier.</i> Heard a capital song at the "Pav." the other
night&mdash;something
about a Cock-eyed Kipper. Just suit my voice. I could
easily get the words and music, and do that for you&mdash;if you like.</p>

<p><i>Several Voices.</i> A Cock-eyed Kipper! It sounds too killing! Oh,
we must have that!</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>[pg 185]</span>

<p><i>Lady Damp.</i> Might I ask what kind of creature a&mdash;a "Cock-eyed
Kipper" may be?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Gard.</i> Oh, well, I suppose it's a sort of a dried herring&mdash;with
a squint, don't you know.</p>

<p><i>Lady Damp.</i> I see no humour in making light of a personal
deformity, I must say.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Gard.</i> Oh, don't you? <i>They</i> will&mdash;it'll go with a scream there!</p>

<p><i>Miss Diova Rose.</i> Yes, poor dears&mdash;and we mustn't mind being
just a little vulgar for once&mdash;to cheer them up.</p>

<p><i>Lady Honor.</i> I have been to the Pavilion and the Tivoli
myself, and I heard nothing
to object to. I know I was
much more amused than I
ever am at theatres&mdash;<i>they</i>
bore me to death.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Bagotrix.</i> We might
finish up with <i>Mrs. Jarley's
Waxworks</i> you know.
Some of you can be the
figures, and I'll come on
in a bonnet and shawl as
<i>Mrs. Jarley</i>, and wind you
up and describe you. I've
done it at lots of places in
the country; brought in
personal allusions and all
that sort of thing, and made
everybody roar.</p>

<p><i>Lady Damp.</i> But will
the East-Enders understand
your personal allusions?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Bag.</i> Well, you see,
the people in the front
rows will, which is all <i>I</i>
want.</p>

<p><i>Lady Honor</i> (<i>suspiciously</i>).
Isn't <i>Mrs. Jarley</i>
out of <i>Pickwick</i>, though?
That's <span class="sc">Dickens</span> surely!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Bag.</i> (<i>reassuringly</i>).
Nothing but the name, Lady
<span class="sc">Honor</span>. I make up all the
patter myself, so that'll be
all right&mdash;just good-natured
chaff, you know; if
any body's a offended&mdash;as I've
known them to be&mdash;it's no
fault of mine.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Flitt.</i> Oh! I'm sure
you will make it funny,&mdash;and
about getting someone
to preside&mdash;I suppose
we ought to ask the Vicar
of the nearest church?</p>

<p><i>Lady Honor.</i> Wouldn't
it be better to get somebody&mdash;a&mdash;more
in Society, don't
you know?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Flitt.</i> Yes; and he
might offer to pay for hiring
the Hall, and the other expenses.
I never thought of
that. I'll see whom I can
get. Really I think it
ought to be great fun, and
we shall have the satisfaction of feeling we are doing real good,
which is such a comfort!</p>

<h2>CLERICAL OUTCOMES.</h2>

<h4><i>To the Editor of "The St-nd-rd."</i></h4>

<p><span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;Allow me to mention, under all reserve, that I <i>frequently</i>
preach a sermon of <span class="sc">Jeremy Taylor's</span>, or the Judicious <span class="sc">Hooker's,</span>
to my congregation, with excellent effect, and hitherto without any
discovery on their part of the origin of the discourse. I, of course,
alter the old-fashioned phrases, and bring the sermons up to date,
so to speak. This plan saves the inconvenience of having to <i>pay</i> for
sermons, which I could not do in cash in these days of clerical
destitution, only in sermon paper, which I fear would not be accepted. If
I am accused of "cribbing sermons," I deny the charge with indignation. I don't
crib <span class="sc">Jeremy</span>, I <i>adapt</i> him. Does every dramatist, who adapts from
the French,
acknowledge the fact? Not at all! Neither does&mdash;</p>

<p>Yours unblushingly,</p>

<p class="author"><span class="sc">Borrowed Plume-age.</span></p>

<br />
<p><span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;My congregation is a rustic one. I have tried them with my own
sermons, but my pewrents suffered so severely in consequence, that I have
been obliged to give them up. Last Sunday (following the advice of a lay
friend of mine in Town, in whom I have much confidence) I preached one
of Prebendary <span class="sc">Sheepshanks'</span> "Crampton Lectures" to them, and the
farmers and labourers seemed much impressed. There was, in fact, hardly
an open eye in Church during the hour and a half that the delivery lasted.
The Charity-School children, too, who sat through the whole of it, only had
to be physically admonished by their teacher about once in every half-minute.
When an old village dame afterwards assured me that "she didn't know I was
that larned," I felt&mdash;momentarily&mdash;rather like a wolf in <span class="sc">Sheepshanks'</span>
clothes. But I intend going through the course.</p>

<h3>SPORTING ANSWERS.</h3>

<h4><span class="sc">Country House.</span></h4>

<p><span class="sc">Tyro.</span>&mdash;You are quite
right&mdash;a four-in-hand is worth two in the bush, which, as you justly
observe, no good wine needs. To handle the reins correctly, proceed as
follows. Divide the sum-total of all the reins measured to a <i>millim&egrave;tre</i>
by half a forefinger, no allowance being made for chalk-stones,
or stiff knuckles. Multiply the quotient by the off-wheel-rein, and
add the near leader's blinkers to the result. Then pass your left
thumb under your right middle finger, taking care at the same time
to tie the off-leading-rein round your neck in a sailor's knot. Add six
yards of whipcord to the near leader's shoulders, subtract yourself from
the box, and send us your doctor's bill, for purposes of comparison.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Who's Who?</span>&mdash;(1) <i>Roundabout Sammy</i> is a very promising horse,
by <i>Engineer</i>, out of <i>Little Joker</i>. He was not bred in France, for,
though there is a Parisian accent about some of his neighs, there is a
distinctly British look about his nose. He is a trifle cobby, no doubt,
but he is a capital feeder, and should go well in a double harness, with
84 '<i>Pommery</i>, his constant stable companion. (2.) Peat Moss Litter
is not generally used for soup, or table decorations. (3.) The
appearance you refer to is probably <i>rubinosis brandiginiata</i>. It is
due to the absorption of <i>liquor per haustum</i>. The snakes you sent
us are indigenous to the hill-country of Del Trementi.</p>

<h2>UNCLE TOBY AND WIDOW WADMAN.</h2>

<h4><span class="sc">(Modern Ulster Version.)</span></h4>

<h4><i>A Fragment after the Fashion of Sterne.</i></h4>
<table summary="" align="center" border="0">
<tr><td class="main"><i>Uncle Toby</i></td><td>&nbsp;</td> <td class="main">Mr. <span class="sc">J-hn B-ll</span>.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="main"><i>Widow Wadman</i></td><td>&nbsp;</td> <td class="main">Mrs. <span class="sc">Ulst-r</span>.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>"<span class="sc">I am</span> half distracted, Captain <span class="sc">Shandy</span>," said Mrs.
<span class="sc">Wadman</span>,
holding up her cambric handkerchief to her left eye, as she
approached the door of my Uncle <span class="sc">Toby's</span> Sentry-Box&mdash;"a mote, or
sand, or small fly, or something, I know not what, has got into this
eye of mine. The Gardener declares it is one of those Green Flies
which are the pest of this Distressful Country. I refuse to believe
<i>that</i>. There never was, never will, never can, never <i>shall</i> be any
Green in <i>my</i> eye. But whatever it is, mote or beam, it is awfully
irritating. Do look into it; it is not in the white, or perhaps I
should say&mdash;for I am a brunette of olive complexion, you know&mdash;in
the Yellow&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>In saying which, Mrs. <span class="sc">Wadman</span> edged herself close in beside my
Uncle <span class="sc">Toby</span>, and squeezing herself down upon the corner of his
bench, she gave him an opportunity of doing it without rising up
"<i>Do</i> look into it!" said she.</p>

<p>Honest soul! Thou wast ever being adjured to "look into"
things, all sorts of things, from Widow's eyes to matters of far
wider scope, and infinitely less simplicity and clarity. And thou
didst look into it with as much innocency and simple good-will as
ever child looked into a raree show-box.</p>

<p>If a man will be prying, of his own accord, into things of such
ticklish and troublesome, not to say perilous nature&mdash;I've nothing
to say to it.</p>

<p>My Uncle <span class="sc">Toby</span> never did, being naturally of an unobservant and
easy-going nature; and I will answer for him, that he would have
sat quietly in his seat in that Sentry Box or the House from
February to September (which you know were his favourite months
for serious Session) with an eye as fine and soft as the Thracian
Rhodope's, or as threatening and commanding as that of Mars&mdash;even
a hectoring fiery thrasonic Hibernian Mars&mdash;himself, without being
able to tell whether it was a black or a blue one, or even a Green or
a Yellow.</p>

<p>The difficulty was to get my Uncle <span class="sc">Toby</span> to look into things at all.</p>

<p>'Tis surmounted. And&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I see him yonder, with his pipe pendulous in his hand, and the ashes
falling out of it, looking, and looking, then rubbing his eyes and
looking again, with twice the good-nature that ever <span class="sc">Galileo</span> looked
for a spot in the sun.</p>

<p>In vain! For by all the powers which animate the organ, Widow
<span class="sc">Wadman's</span> left eye shines this moment as lucid as her right. 'Tis
true the unfortunate, and something irate lady&mdash;and what lady
would <i>not</i> be irate at the charge of having aught of Green in her
eye?&mdash;hath with her cambric handkerchief rubbed the sinister orb
into a state of roseate irritation&mdash;externally&mdash;but there is neither
mote, nor sand, nor dust, nor chaff, nor speck, nor fly,&mdash;Green or
otherwise&mdash;nor particle of solid opaque matter floating in it. 'Tis,
indeed, pure optic illusion on the Widow's part, illusion born,
perchance, partly of fear, partly of pique. There is nothing, my
dear paternal Uncle, but one lambent, feverish fire, deliciously
attractive, even in its angry heat, fascinating even whilst phlogistic,
shooting out from every part of it, in all directions, into thine&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;If thou lookest, Uncle <span class="sc">Toby</span>, in search of this imaginary mote
one moment longer&mdash;thou art undone.</p>

<p>An eye is, for all the world, exactly like a cannon in this respect;
that it is not so much the eye or the cannon, in themselves, as it is
the carriage of the eye&mdash;and the carriage of the cannon, by
which both the one and the other are enabled to do so much
execution. The Widow's eye, owing mainly to the militant and
menacing carriage thereof, <i>looked</i> as formidable as a whole park of
artillery, ranged up to defend a final fortification, or, as it might be,
Last Ditch of defence. Whether it were exactly as fierce or formidable
as it seemed&mdash;well, that was a question which my Uncle <span class="sc">Toby</span>
had not yet fully "looked into"&mdash;as he was now doing into Widow
<span class="sc">Wadman's</span> left eye.</p>

<p>"I protest, Madam," said my Uncle <span class="sc">Toby</span>, "I can see nothing
whatever in your eye!"</p>

<h3>UNCLE TOBY AND WIDOW WADMAN.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: 2em;">(<i>Modern Ulster Version. After C. R. Leslie, R.A.'s celebrated picture.</i>)</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Mrs. Ulster.</span> "NOW, MR. BULL, DO YOU SEE ANY '<i>GREEN</i>' IN MY EYE?"</p></div>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>[pg 189]</span>

<p>But this was not what the Widow wanted.</p>

<p>"It is not in the white, or yellow," said Mrs. <span class="sc">Wadman</span>. My
Uncle <span class="sc">Toby</span> looked with might and main into the pupil.</p>

<p>Now there never, surely, was an eye so fitted to rob my Uncle
<span class="sc">Toby</span> of his repose as the very eye at which he was looking. It
was not, Madam, a rolling eye, a dissatisfied or a revolutionary
one&mdash;nor was it an eye wicked, wanton, or wandering&mdash;but it
<i>was</i> an eye sparkling, petulant, and imperious, of high claims, and
large exactions&mdash;an eye full of brisk challenges and sharp responses,
an eye of satisfied strength and confident ascendancy&mdash;speaking, not
like the dulcet appeal of a mellow flute, but like the trumpet stop of
some powerful party organ. The cornea was perhaps a shade sallow
or so, even verging on the Widow's favourite Yellow&mdash;(for the
Widow, like some modern decorative artists, was sweet upon all
tawny tints, from the most delicate buff to the most <i>flamboyant</i>
Orange)&mdash;but as to any touch, tint, or tone of her chromatic
antipathy, Green&mdash;&mdash;!!!</p>

<p>"Now, <i>dear</i> Mr. <span class="sc">Shandy</span>," cried the Widow, edging nearer, and
opening the optic to its widest, "tell me&mdash;tell me truly, <i>do</i> you,
<i>can</i>
you detect the slightest suspicion of Green in <i>my</i> eye&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I protest, Madam," said my Uncle <span class="sc">Toby</span>, "I can see nothing
whatever of the sort!"</p>

<h2>THE B. AND S. DRAMA AT THE ADELPHI.</h2>
<br />
<div class="figleft"><a href="images/189a-900.png"><img src="images/189a-330.png" width="330" height="445" alt="B-ch-n-n. 'The prize from the lucky-bag'--" /></a><br /><br /><br />
<p><i>B-ch-n-n.</i> "The prize from the lucky-bag"&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>S-ms.</i> "A blank?"<br /><br /></p></div>

<p>"<span class="sc">Some</span> one has blundered!" Who? The Messrs. <span class="sc">Gatti</span>, in sending
to Messrs. <span class="sc">Buchanan</span> and <span class="sc">Sims</span> ("B. &amp; S.") for an Adelphi
melodrama? Surely not! These two might have been trusted to
turn out the right article. So the <span class="sc">Gattis</span> leave the Court without a
stain on their managerial character. Therefore, 'tis the brother-authors,
"<i>hoi Adelphoi</i>," who have blundered. Undoubtedly. An Adelphi audience
is not to be satisfied with a one-scene piece, when that scene is without any
incident
in it worth a melodramatic father's cuss. A fancy-dress ball at Covent Garden,
however well put on the stage,&mdash;and, after all, it has not beaten the record of
the
Masked Ball at the Opera House in Paris, as given in Mr. <span class="sc">Irving's</span>
revival of <i>The Corsican Brothers</i>,&mdash;will not carry a piece of far stronger
calibre
than <i>The Black Domino</i>, and it won't carry this. Neither will
a charming "set," representing the terrace of the "Star and Garter,"
at Richmond, carry a piece to a successful finale, if the audience
has lost all interest in the characters, and does not very much care
what becomes of any one of them, male or female. To the play-goer
it is not attractive; he has seen it all before. "He knows that
man and that woman,&mdash;they come from Sheffield;" <i>i.e.</i>, the persons
and the incidents are taken out of a lot of dramas which dwell in
his memory, from <span class="sc">Boucicault's</span> <i>Formosa</i> at Drury Lane, up to
<span class="sc">Oscar's</span> <i>Lady Windermere's Fan</i> at the St. James's. Of course,
my imaginary play-goer is the Bill of the play, who has "matured,"
and is not a junior member of the Play-goer's Club. Then, in the
old blind German, there is a touch of <span class="sc">Tom Taylor's</span> <i>Helping
Hands</i>,
and, as for all the rest of the characters, well, they can be found
in the common stock-pot of the melodramatic authors of the last
half-century, for, like <span class="sc">Shakspeare</span> himself, these wicked lawyers
and gamblers&mdash;the aiders and a-betters&mdash;are "not for an age"
(would they were, and that age passed!) "but for all time!"</p>



<p>Nothing saves the piece from being absolutely dull, except the
admirable acting, and, I may add, the scenery. It is impossible to
count upon renewing such effects as those in <i>Formosa, The Flying
Scud,</i> and in the <i>Prodigal Daughter</i> at Drury Lane, wherein the
wrong horse was poisoned (in a really dramatic scene), and <span class="sc">Leonard
Boyne</span>, riding the winner, cleared the brook, thus causing part-author
<span class="sc">Druriolanus</span> to clear&mdash;any amount of money. There are no two
exciting scenes like these in this Adelphi drama. Its comic relief
is "poor relief," and would go for nothing at all, were it not in the
hands of Mr. <span class="sc">Dale</span>, who played and sang so well in <i>Miss Decima</i> at
the Criterion, and of the vivacious Miss <span class="sc">Clara Jecks</span>.</p>

<p>Mr. W. <span class="sc">Dennis</span>, as the <i>Earl of Arlington</i>,
is own brother to the old Peer in <i>The Bauble Shop</i>. Perhaps this is
a tribute to the representative of the aristocracy at the Criterion,
or it indicates with great subtlety that, like Members of Parliament,
"Peers are, after all, human&mdash;very human," and that one old
Peer is uncommonly like another old Peer. Miss <span class="sc">Evelyn Millard</span>,
as the soprano heroine, and Mrs. <span class="sc">Patrick Campbell</span> as the base
heroine, look handsome, and act excellently. They take the audience
with them as far as the audience will go. As good as they possibly
can be in such conventional puppet-parts are Messrs. <span class="sc">Glenny</span> and
<span class="sc">Abingdon</span>, the first as the well-intentioned but
weak-willed <i>Lord Dashwood</i>, and the second as that old-fashioned
scoundrel, <i>Captain Greville</i>. Mr. <span class="sc">Arthur Williams</span> rather suggests
Mr. <span class="sc">Blakeley</span> as the oily, scoundrelly lawyer, <i>Joshua Honybun</i>;
and Mr. <span class="sc">Le Hay</span> gives variety to the entertainment (which
is his special line) in the entirely new and original character part of
<i>an Irish Major</i>, with nothing particularly humorous to say, and
nothing at all, humorous, or otherwise, to do.</p>

sensation. The Adelphi piece, however, has its advantages, and
among these its chiefest is, that it necessitates the taking of light
refreshment immediately afterwards. Fortunately, the Adelphi is
close to our old friend <span class="sc">Rule's</span> in Maiden Lane, and for this
hospitable shelter our party made in haste; and, before the
arrival of the crowd of supper-numeraries, gained a table, on
which were soon placed appetising and drinkatising oysters, followed
by the grateful stout. "Pretty to see," as <span class="sc">Pepys</span> hath
it, at the very next table to us, the good hero of the drama
welcoming the double-dyed villain, chiding him for being a few
minutes late, and then drowning all past dramatic animosities in the
flowing bowl. "See how these players love one another!" So
have I seen politicians, mortal enemies in the House, hob-nobbing
together at the dinner-table of some hospitable Impartial. "And
thus it is," said I to myself, said I, "that 'all the world's a
stage, and men and women' like to have supper after the play and
enjoy themselves generally." So philosophising, we, my companion
and I, lighted the pipe of peace&mdash;I should say a cigar a-piece&mdash;and
returned home satisfied with our excellent supper. <i>Vive</i>
<span class="sc">Bayliss! Britannia</span> rules the waves, and this is the last month for
oysters till the arrival of another month with an "r" in it; but,
<i>en attendant</i>, there will appear some very small, very sweet, and very
digestible lobsters! "<i>Le jeu ne vaut pas la chandelle?</i>" But an
indifferent play is well worth a first-rate supper, which may be a
shell-fish view, but at all events, if (like the jest) it be "a poor thing,"
yet 'tis mine own (for the time being), and thereto I sign my hand.</p>

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<h4>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h4>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, April</i> 10. &mdash;"Quite refreshing,"
murmured <span class="sc">Grandolph</span>, looking round at the Party, to which, as he
said at Liverpool the other day, he is thoroughly attached, "to see
how good Conservatives enjoy <span class="sc">Chamberlain's</span> Speech. They are as
jubilant now as they were a few years ago, when I attacked <span class="sc">Joseph</span>
in connection with Aston-Park Riots. A topsy-turvy world; most
of us where we never thought to find ourselves, or be found; oddest
of all, surely, is to hear <span class="sc">Chamberlain</span> of Birmingham enthusiastically
cheered in House of Commons by great Conservative
Party. They mean it, too," <span class="sc">Grandolph</span> added, still scanning
the beaming faces on the Benches behind. "It is almost an
intellectual delight to them."</p>

<p>"Yes," said <span class="sc">Plunket</span>, "they are acutely pleased to hear so
smartly said what they think they thought."</p>

<p>Truly a stirring of the sluggish pool during hour and half that
<span class="sc">Chamberlain</span> stepped in. Speech full of bitterness; effect immeasurably
increased by perfect equability of manner, and the
utterance of a voice ever soft and low&mdash;a beautiful thing in a man
who says nasty things of parted friends. If one stone deaf had
sat in Gallery and watched <span class="sc">Joseph</span>, as he gracefully bent over
towards Treasury Bench, whereon sat his one-time revered Leader
and the still faithful band of followers, he would naturally have
imagined <span class="sc">Joseph</span> was complimenting him and them upon the
perfectness of their measure, and the prospect of the Irish wilderness,
under its beneficent influence, blossoming like the rose. Deaf man
would have been mistaken; <span class="sc">Joseph</span> saying nothing of the kind;
indeed, quite the reverse, as deaf man, turning his eyes on Mr. G.,
would begin to suspect.</p>

<p>Wide differences between Mr. G. and J. C.; none so marked as
their demeanour throughout debate. The wilder the storm of interruption
rages round <span class="sc">Joseph</span>, the more urbane he becomes, and
the more dangerous. Mr. G., standing on the commanding eminence
he has built for himself in the House of Commons, is the sport of
most inconsiderable Member. Anyone, with whatever bungling hand,
can "draw" him. To-night, whilst <span class="sc">Joseph</span> smiled his way through
all the spiteful things he had stored up for gratification of old
friends, Mr. G. sat restless, with clouded brow, face pale with anger,
every now and then springing up with hot correction. Which was
just what <span class="sc">Joseph</span> wanted to achieve.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Third Day Debate on Second Reading Home-Rule
Bill.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Ellis Ashmead-Bartlett</span> (Knight) back again.
"He's Knight and Morning," said leal <span class="sc">Tom Sutherland</span>, of the
P. &amp; O., looking on admiringly from the starboard poop. In a sense
this is true, for <span class="sc">Ashmead</span> gave us a full hour's discourse last night,
and here in broad day, on threshold of another sitting, proposes to add
another forty minutes. <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span> had quite a time with him
last night. He was, so to speak, the Boy left on the Burning Deck
whence all but he Had Fled. Right Hon. Gentlemen on Front Opposition
Bench, following example set in other parts of House, cleared
out when <span class="sc">Ashmead</span> appeared at table with prodigious roll of
manuscript in red right hand. <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span> looked wistfully
towards door, but, remembering leading precept of <span class="sc">Old Morality</span>,
determined to stay, and do duty to <span class="sc">Queen</span> and Country. So sat it
out till midnight struck; Debate automatically closed, and <span class="sc">Speaker</span>
called on next Order of the Day.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Ashmead</span>, pleased with his success, and pondering on fresh
delights in store for House when it met again, remained standing at
table, reflectively arranging his papers. Horrible thought suddenly
struck him; froze his veins, and paled his brow. With
generous desire that country should fully share advantages of
House, he had his speech printed in advance. Copies sent to newspapers.
Suppose they printed it all, whereas he had not found
opportunity to deliver more than half of it! Awakened from reverie
by violent tugging at coat-tails. This was <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span>, signalling
him to sit down, with perhaps unnecessary vigour. But <span class="sc">Prince
Arthur</span> had a long score (fully an hour long) to pay off.</p>

<p>Great speech finished at to-day's sitting; another hour saw it
through. "I think I had <i>my</i> hour last night," said <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span>,
as, on rising of his esteemed colleague, he hastily passed out.
Example again contagious; Benches emptied; but <span class="sc">Ellis Ashmead</span>
pounded along. There was the speech reproachfully facing him in
its portentous-printed length; must be reeled off, though the glass
roof fell. Did it at last; sat down, flushed, and triumphant.
Members, warily assuring themselves speech really finished, began
to stream back again, till all the Benches filled to hear <span class="sc">Davitt</span>.
Excellent speech; full of human nature; illumined by gleams of
grim, humour; better if it had been shorter by a third; but quality
so good, that House, now crowded, sat it all out.</p>

<p>A Nasty One for Joseph; or, a Gentle Reminder from Just-in Time
McC-rthy.</p></div>

<p>"Curious to think," said the <i>Squire of Malwood</i>, who just now
has unusually full opportunities for reflection, "that a few years
ago <span class="sc">Davitt</span> was working out the Irish Question with a rope over his
shoulder, dragging a cart of stones through the court-yard of one of
Her Majesty's prisons. No one, casually coming across him at
Portland, would have ventured to forecast the hour when, standing
up, the centre of interest in an applauding House of Commons, he
should have had an opportunity of reasoning with the only
occasionally <span class="sc">Dum Barton</span>, warning him against the practice of
treason-felony, and reminding him that the pathway to the Bench
does not lie by way of the dock. No parallel in politics to the Irish
Question. Some of us have our earlier studies interrupted by a
sentence of imprisonment; others, I daresay, will, later on, find in
similar chaste repose opportunity of reviewing our connection
with it."</p>

<p>Mr. D-v-tt says no British Bill can pass while the Irish Bill

<p>Involuntarily the eye of the Great Philosopher rested on the
graceful figure of <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span>, whose speech at Belfast, on the
Philosophy of Rebellion, <span class="sc">Davitt</span> just now cited in justification of
the overt acts that led him to Portland.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Fourth Night Home-Rule Debate.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;"In spite of all temptation, I have hitherto remained
a Member of House of Commons," <span class="sc">Chaplin</span> said to me just now.
"I might by this time, had I pleased, been a Duke, and my most
unscrupulous detractor will not deny that is a position I could fill
with pictorial effect; but I've stuck to the Commons, and this is
my reward."</p>

<p>Truly a striking episode. <span class="sc">Chaplin</span> delivered oration on Home-Rule
Bill hour and half long. Had sat up night and day with
it, polishing its rotund periods, till, as <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span> whispers,
"<span class="sc">Chaplin</span>, gazing upon their surface, saw not himself, but
<span class="sc">Demosthenes</span>." Fortune favoured him in opportunity. Member
for Sunderland had secured privilege of resuming Debate after
Questions. Resolved to make long <span class="sc">Storey</span> short, he sacrificed his
position. <span class="sc">Chaplin</span> nimbly stepped in, and reasonably looked forward
to crowning epoch in shining Parliamentary career. To
open or resume Debate between four and five in afternoon is a
prized opportunity; accident had placed it within <span class="sc">Chaplin's</span>
grasp; the hour had struck, and here, at the table, was the Man.</p>

<p>Alack, for the instability of human prospects! When the House,
fairly full, beheld the sunny presence at the table, watched it produce
the vaporous folds of manuscript, noted the shrug of satisfaction
with which it set about its self-appointed task, it folded
its tent like the Arab, and, though not as silently, stole away.
Trundled and bundled out, with ostentatious indifference to great
orator, the fund of information he had garnered, the counsel with
which he was charged. <span class="sc">Chaplin</span> had brought statesmanship and
literature of Europe into review, picking out from encyclop&aelig;dic
stores testimony to destruction of Mr. G.'s pet scheme. The very
names quoted were a liberal education&mdash;Mr. <span class="sc">Lecky</span>, Count <span class="sc">Beust,
Cavour</span>, Dr. <span class="sc">Geffcken</span>, M. <span class="sc">de Molinaris</span>. And then
interposes
the <span class="sc">Sage of Queen Anne's Gate</span> with bland deferential inquiry&mdash;</p>

<p>"I beg the Right Hon. Gentleman's pardon, I did not catch the
name. Was it <span class="sc">M. Apollinaris</span>?"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;"><a href="images/192c-1000.png"><img src="images/192c-400.png" width="400" height="390" alt="M. L-b-ch-re (thinking of Welsh Disestablishment, asks Mr. Ch-pl-n).'Did you say 'Mr. Ap Ollinaris?''" /></a>
<p><i>M. L-b-ch-re</i> (<i>thinking of Welsh Disestablishment, asks
Mr. Ch-pl-n</i>).
"Did you say 'Mr. Ap Ollinaris?'"</p></div>

<p><span class="sc">Chaplin</span> stared haughtily over <span class="sc">Sage's</span> head, and went on. So did
fragments of audience, the latter towards the door, till, almost in
solitude, there rolled forth the treasured peroration. This bad, but
worse followed, when immediately succeeded an obscure Irishman,
whom <span class="sc">Chaplin</span> vaguely remembers a few years back as a Committee
Clerk, or something of that kind. Benches swiftly filled up, and an
assembly that vaunts itself most critical audience in the world
followed, with rapt attention, the simple sentences of obscure <span class="sc">John
Redmond</span>, Ex-Committee Clerk&mdash;this same audience that had scornfully
treated the portentous periods of the Right Hon. <span class="sc">Henry
Chaplin</span>, sometime Cabinet Minister.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Fifth Night's Debate.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Prince <span class="sc">Arthur</span>, enumerating Statesmen anxious to
speak in Debate, doling them out at the rate of one a day, omitted
Cousin <span class="sc">Cranborne</span>. Doubtless accidental; Noble Lord has his
revenge; worked off his speech to-night whilst <span class="sc">Asquith</span> addressing
House. Consisted of only single word; effect instantaneous, startling.
Into <span class="sc">Asquith's</span> fervent eulogium on <span class="sc">Davitt, Cranborne</span> dropped
the additional description, "Murderer." Was only thinking aloud
as he explained to House; just talking genially to himself; regretted
he was overheard, and begged to apologise.</p>

<p>"It's the principle of heredity," said <span class="sc">Tim Healy</span>; "the father
calls us all Hottentots; the son accuses one of us of murder."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Sixth Night's Debate on Home-Rule Bill.</p>
